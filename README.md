# IQ Test App

This is a simple Java-based IQ/Quiz application I built while practicing core Java and basic project structuring. The goal of this project is to create a lightweight quiz system where users answer a set of questions and get their score at the end. It’s small, easy to understand, and perfect for beginners who want to explore Java logic building.
